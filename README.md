# page friends api

## Summary

A little API backend I'm writting in go to aid in catalogging my books.
I've wanted to write my own for a while just to manage our library. But,
I wanted to craft it to our needs. Something that I can add and remove
features as I see fit.

This is the API for Page Friends. This will handle all of the backend
communication with the database. It wont do just that. There are some
feature ideas I have that this will perform that I'm not ready to
discuss in this README.

## Features

Currently there aren't a whole lot of features.

- Display books in catalog.
- Add books to catalog.
- Display authors in catalog.
- Add authors to catalog.
